		<h1 class="Title">Sloths</h1>
        
        <p class="text">Sloths are arboreal mammals noted for slowness of movement and for spending most of their lives hanging upside down in the trees of the tropical rain forests of South America and Central America. </p>
        <p class="text">There are 6 species of sloth split between two very different families: the three-fingered (Bradypodidae, genus: Bradypus) and the two-fingered (Megalonychidae, genus: Choloepus). Although commonly referred to as three-toed and two-toed, all sloths actually have three toes; the true difference lies in the number of digits on the forelimb (the fingers).This is now recognized in numerous publications as the correct terminology for these animals.</p>

        <h1 class="Title">The Two-Fingered: Choloepus</h1>

            <div class="p-vid">
                <p class="text"><br><br><br><br><br>Choloepus is a genus of mammals of Central and South America within the monotypic family Choloepodidae, consisting of two-toed sloths (also less misleadingly known as "two-fingered" sloths). The two species of Choloepus (which means "lame foot"), Linnaeus's two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus) and Hoffmann's two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni), were formerly believed on the basis of morphological studies to be the only surviving members of the family Megalonychidae, but have now been shown by molecular results to be closest to extinct ground sloths of the family Mylodontidae.</p>

            <div class="p-vid">
                <p class="text"><br><br><br><br><br>The three-toed sloths are tree-living mammals from Latin America. They are the only members of the genus Bradypus and the family Bradypodidae. The four living species of three-toed sloths are the brown-throated sloth, the maned sloth, the pale-throated sloth, and the pygmy three-toed sloth. In complete contrast to past morphological studies, which tended to place Bradypus as the sister group to all other folivorans, molecular studies place them nested within the sloth superfamily Megatherioidea, making them the only surviving members of that radiation.</p>
